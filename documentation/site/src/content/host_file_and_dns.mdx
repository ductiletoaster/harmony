## Introduction

### Domain Resolution Strategy

This setup uses a dual-domain approach for accessing services:

- **`.localhost`** - For on-machine access (resolves to 127.0.0.1)
- **`.lan`** - For network access (configured in OpenWrt router settings)

### DNS Configuration 
Currently I manage DNS records for the following subdomains whcih map to specific local addresses in my network. 
192.168.68.200  nas.local.briangebel.com 
192.168.68.201  workstation-01.local.briangebel.com 
192.168.68.202  workstation-02.local.briangebel.com 

### OpenWrt Configuration

The `.lan` domain resolution is configured in your OpenWrt router settings to point to your server's IP address. This allows other devices on your network to access services using the `.lan` domain.

For Docker services with Traefik, the default rule automatically generates both domains:
- `servicename.docker.localhost` (local access)
- `servicename.storage-01.lan` (network access)

### Hostfile


### Debugging
At times Chrome/Chromium need it's DNS cache cleared.
